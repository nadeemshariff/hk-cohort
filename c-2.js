// Functions
// 1. Abstract out logic in your program
// 1.1- Take argumemnts as an input
// 1.2- Return a value as an output
// 1.3- think them as a independent program that is supposed to do something given in an input
// 1.4- functions can take other functions as input - this will confuse you(callbacks)


// 2. Create reusable code

// 3. Modularize your code

// 4. Test your code

// 5. Clean up your code

// 6. Refactor your code
// 6.1- Refactoring is the process of changing a computer program's source code without
// changing the program's behavior. 
// 6.2- Refactoring is a fundamental part of software development, and is often used
// to improve the quality of code.
// 6.3- Refactoring is a process of improving the design of existing code without
// changing its behavior.

// function sum(a,b) {
//     const add = a + b;
//     return add;
// }

// const value = sum(1,2)
// console.log(value);
